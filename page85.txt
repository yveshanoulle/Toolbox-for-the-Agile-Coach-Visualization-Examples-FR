Visualize Internal Queues

One of the seven wastes of software development is queues. One approach to reveal bottlenecks within a team is to visualize internal queues. This can be done by making it visual when tasks are actually being worked on, or waiting to be worked on.

For example: instead of just having a “Test” column, split the column into “Ready for test” and “Testing”, or split “Review” into “Waiting for review” and “Reviewing”.

If tasks get congested in any of these internal queues, you’ve found your bottleneck and can start discussing how to address this as a team.
