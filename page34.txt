Interruption buckets

Do you suspect that most of your interruptions have a common origin and source? Do you have a growing frustration towards someone or something? To turn that frustration into a data driven insight and data driven decision to change something, collect your interruptions on Post-its and sort them according to category. 

Do this for a couple of weeks and then bring the notes to a workshop where you analyze and discuss how you can reduce the frequency or pain of the interruptions. Or, instead of having a time-limit, whenever there are 5 or more notes in a bucket – call for an interruption reduction workshop.
