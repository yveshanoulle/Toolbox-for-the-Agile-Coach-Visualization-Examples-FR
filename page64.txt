Test Server Icons & Info

If your team uses several different physical or virtual test environments, and this causes confusion, make it easier to see where things can be tested and the state of each test environment.





Additional details, such as server name, purpose, version, branch, date of upgrade etc., are put somewhere next to the wall. The color of the icons corresponds to the colors of these server notes.
