Hourglass Scrumm Wall

A Scrum wall doesn’t need to be in the shape of a grid. The Hourglass Scrum Wall replaces a User Story lane with an Hourglass where tasks flow downwards. It provides two natural dimensions for limiting work in progress; the number of concurrent User Stories, and an upper limit of two active tasks per User Story. If a story is too small to be broken down into tasks (i.e. the team can finish the entire story within a day) it simply occupies the whole Hourglass.
 
Not separating “Work in progress” into “Coding”, “Reviewing”, and “Testing” and so on also enforces cross-discipline collaboration and knowledge sharing.
