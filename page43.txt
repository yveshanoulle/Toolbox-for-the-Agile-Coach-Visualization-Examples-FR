Today’s Headlines

Many times teams start or end their Daily Stand-up with a general information sharing moment. 

To reduce the chance that you forget to share something important with your team, add your news headlines to the “Today’s Headline” whiteboard area as soon as you come to think of a topic.

When the news or information has been shared, clear the area so that new headlines can be added for the next day.
