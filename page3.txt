Welcome

This book is filled with visualization examples for teams to improve collaboration and communication, as well as shaping behaviors. It is written for people and teams working within an agile software development context.

The pages within only depict examples. Nothing else. No deep theoretical explanations. No explanation of Agile or Scrum. No references to Gamification. No discussion on how the brain interprets visual input or how our behaviors are influenced by visual information. There are other books written on those topics.

If a page contains an arrow (➨) in the upper corner, it means that there is a link to a blog or an article with more information to be found on the page “More information”.

If a page contains a heart (❤) you will find a person or team credited on the page “Sources of inspiration”.

The examples in this book might be perceived as if they are the best and only way of doing things. Of course that is not true. The examples are not best practice. They are only suggestions. You need to adapt them to your team’s context and needs.

This book is not intended to be read cover to cover. Browse. Jump back and forth. Pick what you like. Combine the ideas whichever way you find useful. Experiment and evaluate. Evolve or throw away.

Have fun!
