Christmas Tree

Do you have a pile of boring chores to take care of? Do you have a dung pile of smelly bugs to deal with before you can launch? Is it Christmas time?

Buy yourselves a table sized Christmas tree. Head out for shopping over lunch. Disperse. Everyone buys a couple of presents for a few euros each. For instance, it could be a small gift, something silly or some candy. Hang the presents in the tree.

Policy: When you have completed a boring chore or fixed a bug, you are allowed to reward yourself with a present.
