Visualize your policies

Make your policies, routines, working agreements and rules explicit and visible. Create posters or dedicate a portion of your whiteboard wall to your rules.

Making the policies explicit and visible forces you to come to a shared understanding within the team. It also gives you something concrete to refer to when you’re discussing how to improve your way of working. Every policy should also have an expiration date (3-6 months into the future). When a policy expires, review it! Make a conscious decision to keep, modify or to abandon it.

Yet another tip is to skip the bottom line and add an empty bullet, signaling that there is more to come.
