I want to learn…

Whenever you feel that you lack knowledge about a tool, want to learn more about some part of the system or wish you were better at something, capture it and put it up on the “I want to learn…” poster.

When you spot something that you can contribute with or teach someone else, schedule it and write down when the session, workshop, seminar or lunch & learn will happen. Don’t forget to announce it on the Daily Stand-up or any other appropriate meeting.
