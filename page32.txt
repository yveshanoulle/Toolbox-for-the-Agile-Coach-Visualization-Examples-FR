Team habits

During a retrospective it’s quite common that you decide to try to implement some new habits, to do something differently from now on. If you have a Working Agreement, it should probably be updated. If you don’t have a working agreement (or don’t feel the new policy fits there) create a Team Habits area on your wall. 

Newly decided habits that you have agreed to try to follow are written down on orange Post-its. Once they have become true habits, re-write them on green Post-its. If you become sloppy, change it back to orange. Review your habits on a regular basis (for example once a month).
