Portable boards

It’s quite common that planning or retrospective meetings take place in meeting rooms from where the team’s physical board isn’t visible. And it’s also quite common that you would like to bring part of the wall to those meetings.

One solution to this is to create portable boards, i.e. boards that you can lift down from the wall and bring with you. For example, there are small whiteboards you hang on the wall as you hang a painting. You could also create a foldable mini-board from foam boards and then attach some hooks to it.
