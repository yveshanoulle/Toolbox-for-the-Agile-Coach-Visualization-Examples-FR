Review Queue

One HR team I was working with had a long list of wiki pages describing different policies and guidelines. They suspected a lot of them needed to be revisited and updated. So, we created a Policy Review Queue. Every week one policy was reviewed and updated. Some updates needed approval from someone else so they went through a “To be approved” box. Once done, the ticket moved to the end of the queue. The order and content of the queue was rearranged when needed.

The same approach could of course be applied to technical documentation, website content, FAQs, manuals, etc.
