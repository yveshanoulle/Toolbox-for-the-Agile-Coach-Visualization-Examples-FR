Daily Stand-up Routine

Instead of just jumping into doing the Scrum default “round”, make the routine of the Daily Stand-up a conscious design by writing it down. Once written down it becomes easier to have constructive discussions on how to improve it.

It also makes it easier to rotate the responsibility of facilitating the Daily Stand-up.

The same approach could also of course be applied to other kinds of meetings such as Sprint Planning, Backlog Grooming, Sprint Review, etc.
