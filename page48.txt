Flowglass

Do you want to signal to your colleagues that you want some undisturbed time to focus on something difficult? Reaching a mental state of flow usually requires some undisturbed time, especially when working with complex work such as software engineering.

Invest in an hourglass. Whenever you require some undisturbed flow time, turn the hourglass over and put it on your table. For clarity, perhaps add a note next to it. Your friends can now see that you actively request some time to focus. It’s also easy for them to roughly estimate when it’s ok to come back to you (based on the amount of sand left).
