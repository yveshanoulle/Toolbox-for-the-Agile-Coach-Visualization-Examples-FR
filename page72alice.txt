Retro Input Inbox

When it’s time for the Sprint Retrospective, do you often have a hard time remembering the sprint and what it was you wanted to bring up in the meeting? Why wait to write down your thoughts and ideas until the retrospective, do it continuously!

As soon as something happens or when a thought pops into your mind, capture it, write it down and put it in the “Retro Input Inbox” area. If you think it will add value, note the date and author of the note as well.

When it is time for the retrospective, simply bring all the Post-its from the area.
