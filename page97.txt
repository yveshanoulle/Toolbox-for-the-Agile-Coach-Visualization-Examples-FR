Time Invested

Would you like a lightweight approach for presenting to your stakeholders how you have been investing your time?

At the end of every week, sprint or month, roughly estimate how you have spent your time. Each member draws ten bars. Each bar represents 10% of the invested time. The time is distributed into categories such as; feature development, bug fixes and maintenance, technical investment and quick/panic fixes.

The historical summary is then communicated to stakeholders.
