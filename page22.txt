Absence calendar

This calendar shows when people know they will be away and absent from the office doing something else, avoiding “Does anyone know where Julie is today?” moments. 

Each team member writes his/her name on the date(s) when they know in advance they will be off on vacation, attending a course or doing something else. The calendar could also include holidays or other important events.

The yellow arrow points to the current day and is moved before the Daily Stand-up meeting.
