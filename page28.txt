Parking lot

If the team has temporarily stopped working on a story (or paused a specific task) due to changes in priority – make that clear and transparent by moving the Post-its to a Parking Lot area.

Moving the story/task away from the primary board also reduces the chance that people accidently work on a paused task (i.e. increased unnecessary multitasking).

When a story or task becomes parked, write a Parking Ticket with the date when it became parked and who was working on it.
