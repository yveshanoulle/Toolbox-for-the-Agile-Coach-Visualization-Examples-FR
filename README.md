The project for the French translation.

The idea is to do the translation page per page.
To show to others you will work on a page, you add your name to the page and commit to github.
Please only one page at the time. When you are finished you can commit your translation and remove your name.
(And start a new page if you feel like it...)

When you are ready, you change the name of the file to page_xxx.txt
F. ex. page1.txt changes to page_0_001.txt
That way the pages at the top are also the pages not yet done.

After the first review we change that same page to page_1_001.txt
After a second review page_2_001.txt
etc

To make the life of the reviewers easier, we keep the English text below the translated text. In order to keep the file easily readable, please separate the french translation and the original text with this separator line:
------------------------------- ORIGINAL TEXT BELOW -----------------------------------------------

When you have added a translation or did a review, please add your name to page122.txt

We start by translating a_glossary, to have a list of typical translation.
This list was created by previous translations, when we need other words, we can add them.

PS: Après discussion avec Yves, peut-être que de simplement mettre son trigramme ou une indication de ce type sur le nom de fichier serait suffisante dans un premier temps, sachant que l'objectif est juste de savoir rapidement qui travaille sur quoi :-)
