Kudos wall

Show more love in the team! Whenever you feel someone else did something great that deserves appreciation and recognition, write a Kudo card and put in on the team’s Kudos Wall!

A Kudo wall is a great way to nurture intrinsic motivation within a team and to self-reward good behaviors.

You can use Post-its, design your own cards that you print, or buy them online here:
