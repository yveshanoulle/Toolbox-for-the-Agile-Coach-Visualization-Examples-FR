Arrival/Departure Timeline

I’ve heard of teams who keep track of important events as their team changes over time. When the team was created, when it got a new name, when its mission changed and when new team members arrived and when members departed from the team.

This creates a sense of common history as well as shows how the team has evolved to where it is today. Even other kinds of events could of course be included, such as major releases, game changing decisions and other organizational changes.
