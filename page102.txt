Discipline Track Record

When getting started with Kanban, one of the first challenges is to be truly disciplined regarding the WIP Limits so that they aren’t exceeded. 

An easy way to be transparent and honest about how disciplined you are as a team is to keep a track record of how often you break any WIP Limit. 

Print (or draw) monthly calendars. By the end of the Daily Stand-up, check if a WIP Limit is exceeded. If it is, make a red fat ugly blob in the calendar. If not, draw a nice green circle.
