After party

When people derail in detailed discussions during the Daily Stand-up meeting, pause them and add the topic to “Immediately after”. The policy could be that whenever anyone makes a T-shaped hand signal, the discussion is moved to after the Daily Stand-up.

Once the Daily Stand-up is wrapped up, those that need to (and those that want to) stick around and discuss the listed topics. Some people call this the “After party”. 

As each topic is resolved, cross it over. When all have been discussed, clean the area so that it’s ready for the next Daily Stand-up.

For some teams this is a great approach to make the Daily Stand-up meetings shorter and more concrete.
