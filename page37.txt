Parking lot with states

When you pause a full story and move the associated tickets to a Parking Lot it might be a good idea to preserve the states of the tasks.

This takes more space, but that could be used as a WIP-limit, i.e. no more than one story may be paused at any single point in time. 

Don’t forget to write down the date when the story became paused.

This approach can be useful when something urgent arrives mid-sprint temporarily overriding the priorities.
