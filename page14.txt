2 Avatars - One big, One small

Each team member has two avatars, one big printed in color and one small printed in grayscale.

They mark which tasks that team member is currently working on. The big one signals the main focus. When blocked on the main task, the smaller grey avatar signals where the person is helping out.

Each team member is only allowed these two avatars. If the person wants to start a third task he/she either needs to finish any of the current ones, or put one of the current ones in the parking lot or move back the task from Doing to Planned.

If you currently only have one avatar for each team member, please ignore this example. You are good :-)
